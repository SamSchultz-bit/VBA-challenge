## Contributor Sam Schultz

### Overview
In this project I created a VBA script that creates a summary table of multible worksheets of stock information. 

I referenced the microsft tutorials at https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/macro-to-loop-through-all-worksheets-in-a-workbook-feef14e3-97cf-00e2-538b-5da40186e2b0 to understnad for to loop through multiple worksheets. Otherwise all code is original.
